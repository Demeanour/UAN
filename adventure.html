         <p class="story">After a quick safety guide, by Mike the owner/operator, we were ready for all out war. We opted for the capture the flag option in an urban setting, broke into teams based on those people I like on my team and the assholes on the other team. Minutes into the game, I felt like a regular G.I Joe taking out the assholes like I was part of the Osama Bin Laden capture team. My joy (and glory) was short lived though because we soon found ourselves under heavy fire from the assholes and very little cover to be had. Being the Rambo wannabe that I am, I went out gun blazing thinking I could take out the enemy all by myself without sustaining a single hit.
           Turns out I was mistaken because just as I left my hiding places, paintballs filling the air like bees on a hot spring day, I turned to face another asshole that was shooting me from the side and took a paintball right to the face. To be clear, the protective gear includes a face mask, but as the paintball hit the mask; I found my mouth filled with warm paint as undeniable proof to my fallibility. </p>
         <p class="story">Beside the mouth filled with paint, the afternoon was a lot of fun and beefs were settled like men, with guns albeit those who shoot paint. Mike allowed us to have a braai afterwards and enjoy a few cold Carling Black Labels before we had to drive home for the after, after party. </p>
