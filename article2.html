				  <p class="story">Local house and radio disc jockey, DJ Tshidye, has been nominated for the 2019 Golden Bean awards in the best DJ category. The diminutive powerhouse has been hard at work producing new music and touring with back to back bookings. </p>

<p class="story">Up-All-Night managed to track down the DJ for a sit-down interview. We met her at the Rock FM studios just before she was about to go on air with her afternoon drive show. Tshidye said the nomination is a culmination of hard work and long nights. “I have bled for this man, obviously this is the first of many but any recognition is encouraging”, said the bubbly DJ. “I’ve been putting in a lot of work in the studio and have released some singles online but my main focus right now is improving on my radio gig, I’m not ready yet to release a full album”.</p>

<p class="story">The DJ believes that the award is simply acknowledgement for the buzz she has been creating around the province. “I have been privileged to do this show for some years now and it has been a big boost on my DJ’ing career but I would also like to think I have grown. I’m building my brand it was just a matter of before there was some recognition”. Tshidye believes she will definitely take the award and already has her sights set on the Liberty Radio Awards come 2020.</p>

<p class="story">Whether or not she wins, Tshidye is a force to be reckoned with and like a good bottle of wine, can only get better with time.</p>

<p class="story">The Golden Bean awards will be taking place on Saturday the 19th of October at the PACOFS in Bloemfontein.</p>

    <p class="story">Contrary to popular belief, the Golden Bean Awards (the Beanies), birthed by Bloemfontein resident, Tebogo Kotsi, are still alive and happening. Speaking to Up-All-Night, Kotsi said that the awards were still happening annually despite the fact that they did not receive the same financial support as they had in earlier years.</p>
